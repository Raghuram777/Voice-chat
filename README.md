## 🔧 Build Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-chat.git
cd voice-chat
```

### Step 2: Setup Dependencies

Ensure the following directory structure exists:

```
external/
├── asio/           # Extract ASIO library here
└── portaudio/      # Extract PortAudio library here
```

### Step 3: Generate Build Files

```bash
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

### Step 4: Build the Project

```bash
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## ▶️ Running the Application

### 1. Start the Server

Open a terminal and navigate to the build directory:

```bash
cd build/Release
./voip_server.exe
```

The server will start listening on the default port and display connection information.

### 2. Start Client(s)

Open additional terminals for each client:

```bash
cd build/Release
./voip_client.exe
```

### 3. Configure Connection

When prompted, enter:
- **Server IP**: `127.0.0.1` (for local testing)
- **Client Port**: Unique port for each client (e.g., `50001`, `50002`)

### Example Usage

```
Terminal 1 (Server):
> voip_server.exe
Server listening on 127.0.0.1:50000...

Terminal 2 (Client 1):
> voip_client.exe
Enter server IP: 127.0.0.1
Enter client port: 50001
Connected! Start speaking...

Terminal 3 (Client 2):
> voip_client.exe
Enter server IP: 127.0.0.1
Enter client port: 50002
Connected! Start speaking...
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key configuration options can be modified in `common/config.h`:

```cpp
// Audio settings
#define SAMPLE_RATE 44100
#define FRAMES_PER_BUFFER 512
#define CHANNELS 1

// Network settings
#define DEFAULT_PORT 50000
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors:**
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check that Visual Studio 2022 is selected as the generator
- Verify C++17 compiler support

**Audio Issues:**
- Check microphone/speaker permissions
- Ensure PortAudio is properly linked
- Try different audio devices

**Network Issues:**
- Verify firewall settings allow UDP traffic
- Check if ports are available and not blocked
- Ensure server is running before connecting clients
